# Data Exploration – Leaf Disease Dataset

This notebook explores the structure and distribution of the leaf disease image dataset.

import os

DATA_DIR = "../data/raw/leaf"

for cls in os.listdir(DATA_DIR):
    cls_path = os.path.join(DATA_DIR, cls)
    print(f"{cls}: {len(os.listdir(cls_path))} images")

## Observations
- Dataset is organized class-wise
- Two classes: Healthy (good) and Infected
- Dataset size is suitable for CNN with augmentation
